Upcoming Paternity Leave in December

Hi [Scrum Master’s Name] / [Manager’s Name],

I wanted to inform you in advance that I’m planning to take my paternity leave in December, tentatively between December 15th and December 26th. The exact dates will be finalized once the delivery date is confirmed, and I’ll keep you updated accordingly.

Before my leave, I’ll ensure all my current tasks, user stories, and deliverables are completed or properly handed over to the team. I’ll also document any pending work and share necessary details to ensure a smooth transition and minimal impact on the sprint.

Please let me know if you’d like me to initiate any formal process or update this in the leave tracker/calendar.

Thanks for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Tamilselvam
