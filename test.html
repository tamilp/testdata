Hi Raj,

I would like to bring to your attention certain concerns regarding the work environment and professional conduct within the Testos team under Lead Manoj. These issues have been affecting not only the motivation of team members but also their overall well-being.

Key points observed:

Team members are being scolded in front of others during calls, which creates a negative atmosphere.

Discussions in calls often lack professionalism, leading to frustration among the team.

This behavior is demotivating several members, including Manogar, who is also facing health-related stress due to the situation.

Multiple team members I have spoken to have expressed similar feelings and concerns.

Such an environment reduces productivity and discourages open communication.

The lack of respectful interactions is impacting team morale and collaboration.

Professional concerns should ideally be addressed one-on-one, instead of being escalated in group calls.

Constructive feedback and appreciation are missing, which is critical for maintaining motivation.

If not addressed, this could lead to higher attrition and disengagement within the team.

A positive and professional culture will help improve both performance and team satisfaction.

I kindly request your guidance and support in addressing this matter so that we can restore a healthy, motivating, and professional work environment.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]
